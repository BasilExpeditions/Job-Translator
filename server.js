// 1. Is this normal ^ Serving my css like this
// 2. How should i be importing my javascript and jquery for event listeners (Input storage --> Mapping through string to find keys --> Output results)
// 3. I feel like serving my json object like this is bad (Can i do something like this without mongoDB or is it bad practice)
// 4. Should i just store input within the jquery event listener and then map through it?
