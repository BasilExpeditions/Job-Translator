    <h4>Idea:</h4>
    <p>This project was just a fun little idea to use in practice some of the technologies that i've learned over the course taught by J.Turnbull, An exceptionally skilled Teacher, Technology Enthusiast & Engineer.</p>

    <h4>Objective:</h4>
    <p>The objective of this application is to be able to copy an entire "Software Engineer" specific job board application information and paste it within this job translator application to find the realsitic result the company is looking for.</p>

    <p>This was a fun little project inspired by an old friend and a small community on the internet, the intention of this application is just for a laugh.
